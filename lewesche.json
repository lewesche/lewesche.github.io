    "about":[
        "I'm currently in the last semester of grad school at USC. My undergraduate degree was in mechanical engineering, but somewhere along the way I got into computer science.",
        "I started grad school with an open mind about what I wanted to focus on. After exploring a variety of topics, I think pursuing a career in systems would be most fulfilling for me. The systems classes I've taken (one on OS and two on networking) have been my favorites. Working with systems, or low level langues in general, feels a little like pulling the curtains back. Seeing how hardware and software work together to build something greater than their parts is what keeps me interested in CS. I still have a lot to learn, and hopefully I'll be lucky enough to find a career where I can keep learning."
